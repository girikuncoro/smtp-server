NETID:  <your netid here>

Describe the contents of an IP packet and for each field describe the purpose it serves.

    <your answer>

Describe the general operation of the BGP protocol.

    <your answer>

Describe why the ethernet protocol necessitates a minimum packet size.

    <your answer>

Describe how TCP reacts to congestion in the network.  Assume that
congestion is brought on by BGP reconfiguring the path such that TCP
packets now go through a bottleneck link of capacity B packets/second.
Describe in detail what TCP will do when faced with this bottleneck.

    <your answer>

Describe TCP's behavior when it is first getting started delivering data
over a high latency, high-bandwidth channel such as a satellite link. Be
sure to explain how TCP manages its window size during the initial
connection setup.

On an ethernet segment, the ARP protocol is used to locate the ethernet
address of a host whose IP address is known. On the Internet, DNS is
used to locate the IP address of a host whose name is known. ARP and
DNS are drastically different -- the former uses a broadcast mechanism
while the latter implements a scalable, distributed database. Explain
why DNS was designed the way it was, and not, for instance, based on
a simple broadcast.

What purpose does the ACK # serve in TCP?

    <your answer>

What purpose does the destination port number serve in UDP?

    <your answer>

Why does UDP include a checksum? Wouldn't the end-to-end argument
require that all checksums be performed at the application level, and
hence argue that UDP and TCP elide such additional checksums in the
network stack?

    <your answer>

Imagine that a mail server on host A has just received a TCP/IP SYN
packet destined for it. Describe everything that happens to this packet
from the point of its reception by the network interface card to the
point of its delivery to the mail server.

In IPv6, why do routers not fragment packets? Then how does IPv6 deal with the issue
of Minimum Transmission Unit (MTU)?

What is the difference between a web proxy and a vpn? When would it be advantageous 
to use a proxy instead of a vpn?
